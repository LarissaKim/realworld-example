# A RealWorld Example App :woman_technologist:

This is a modified implementation of [RealWorld](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/intro), a project used to learn about frontend/backend frameworks by creating a blogging platform. Check out the [official demo](https://demo.realworld.io/#/).

**NOTE**: I started this project because I wanted to play around with AWS solutions. Most of the projects I've worked on so far were front-end heavy, so back-end is a new adventure for me. However, rather than focusing on a specific implementation solution, I've decided to adjust my focus on understanding the underlying principles in a provider-agnostic way. (Think :turtle: not :rabbit2:)
