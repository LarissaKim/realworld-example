# A RealWorld Example App :woman_technologist:

This is a modified implementation of [RealWorld](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/intro), a project used to learn about frontend/backend frameworks by creating a blogging platform. Check out the [official demo](https://demo.realworld.io/#/).

### Entity Relationships

### Data Visualization

|           Main Table            |                 Global Secondary Index 1                 |                 Global Secondary Index 2                 |
| :-----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![Main](./docs/db-table-v1.png) | ![Global Secondary Index 1](./docs/db-table-GSI1-v1.png) | ![Global Secondary Index 2](./docs/db-table-GSI2-v1.png) |

_NOTE: The attribute values `Y`, `1`, and `true` in the above images indicate that the attribute exists for that item and the data type of the value (string, number, or boolean, respectively)._

```

Check out the original [RealWorld Endpoints](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/endpoints)

### Considerations

- Slug must be updated when the author changes the title
- User can change their username
- Usernames should be unique
- Emails should be unique
- Article or comment author profile must be up-to-date
- Current user's following status must be shown when viewing another user's profile, including authors of articles and comments
- A high-traffic production app would likely require write-sharding for articles and article tags to avoid hot partitions

  This project will attempt to implement write-sharding for articles. A global secondary index with the partition key `ARTICLE#YYYY#MM#DD` (year, month, date the article was published) will be used when listing articles. Possible values will be the date the query was made (inclusive) until the date this app was "released" (inclusive).

  Write-sharding article tags could be implemented by showing the top `n` tags, as outlined in a [ "leaderboard" example by Alex De Brie](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/leaderboard-write-sharding). This method will most likely be used when implementing the [Bonus TODO](#bonus).
